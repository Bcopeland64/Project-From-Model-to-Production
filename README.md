# Project From Model to Production

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to an MLOps project focusing on the lifecycle of a machine learning model from its inception to deployment in production. It involves the use of Jupyter Notebooks for model development and HTML for potential visualization or interface components.

## Repository Structure
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Contains the main codebase for the machine learning model development, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization.
- **HTML Files**: Used for creating interactive web-based visualizations or interfaces that complement the machine learning models.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks to understand the workflow from model development to production readiness.
